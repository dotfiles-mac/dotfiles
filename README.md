# GitHub Dotfiles

This repository contains global Git hooks for maintaining consistent commit standards and author identity across your projects.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your home directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bniladridas/GitHub-dotfiles.git ~/GitHub-dotfiles
```

## Usage

### Initial Mac Setup

For a new Mac, first run the setup script to install Zsh, Homebrew, Python, Node.js, Ruby, GitHub CLI, Docker CLI, and opencode. It also offers to log in to Docker Hub as 'harpertoken':

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bniladridas/GitHub-dotfiles/main/setup-mac.sh)"
```

Or download and run the script manually.

Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zprofile` to apply changes.

### Git Hooks Setup

To set up the Git hooks:

1. Make the pre-push hook executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/GitHub-dotfiles/git-hooks/pre-push
   ```

2. Configure Git to use these hooks globally:

   ```bash
   git config --global core.hooksPath ~/GitHub-dotfiles/git-hooks
   ```

3. Set your Git author identity:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Niladri Das"
   git config --global user.email "bniladridas@users.noreply.github.com"
   ```

4. The setup script automatically configures useful Git aliases from `.gitconfig` and lets you choose the bracket type for commit scopes.

   Available aliases:
   - `git track <branch>`: Set upstream to origin/<branch>
   - `git untrack <branch>`: Unset upstream for <branch>
   - `git branches`: List all branches (local and remote)
   - `git status`: Short status
   - `git lg`: Log with graph
   - `git co <branch>`: Checkout
   - `git ci`: Commit
   - `git st`: Status

4. (Optional) Install and set up pre-commit for enhanced checks:

   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install  # In each project repo
   ```

## Features

- **Pre-commit checks**: Runs pre-commit hooks if available (includes Python linting with black/flake8/mypy, C++ formatting/linting with clang-format and clang-tidy, Rust formatting/linting/compilation with rustfmt/clippy, and general checks).
- **YAML linting**: Runs check-yaml from pre-commit.
- **Commit message validation**: Ensures messages follow conventional commit format (lowercase, ≤40 chars, proper type).
- **Author identity verification**: Checks that commits are authored by "Niladri Das" with email "bniladridas@users.noreply.github.com".

## Handling errors

When the hook fails, it will block the push with an error message. Common issues:

- Pre-commit not installed: Install with `pip install pre-commit`
- Commit message format invalid: Use `type(scope): description` (lowercase, ≤40 chars)
- Author identity mismatch: Ensure Git config matches the expected values

## Advanced Usage

### Customizing hooks

You can modify the `pre-push` hook in `git-hooks/pre-push` to add custom checks.

### Accessing raw hook output

The hook outputs detailed messages for each check. Run `git push` to see the validation in action.
